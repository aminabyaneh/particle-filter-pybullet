# Particle Filter PyBullet

Easily try your particle filter implementation in this environment, and have fun!

## Getting started

1. Set up Python with your preferred IDE, e.g., VSCode.
2. Install PyBullet and NumPy.
3. Run ```python3 localization.py --gui``` to run the simulation with GUI enabled.
4. Add your particle filter implementation according to ```pf.py```.
5. Rerun ```localization.py``` and observe possible improvements.

## Possible improvement

1. The observation model here is naive. This can be improved further using neural approximation or other image processing techniques.
2. Filter parameters can always be further tuned, but tuning beyond a certain point has little academic value.
